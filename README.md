## Network Study and the Impact of Social Bots on Public Opinion Polls  
##### CS5344 BigData Final Project - Group 2  

   
### Introduction  
  
In this project, we use multiple twitter data source via web scraping and existing datasets. We first **implement Xgboost model to detect social bots**. Then, we use the labels derived from the social bots detection to conduct three parallel studies including **network analysis using Hubs and Authorities Algorithm (HITS), topic modeling using LSA, NMF, LDA and sentiment analysis using textblob** in order to identify the difference between bots and humans in terms of importance scores, topic trends and sentimental affecting mechanism.    

The overall pipeline works like:  
**1. Data Scraping => 2. Social Bots Detection => 3. Network Analysis & Topic Modeling & Sentiment Analysis**  

  
### Data Resource

1. ```tweets_json.json``` : Kaggle dataset - UK General Elections 2019 - Twitter replies  
This is our main dataset.   
**Notes: To run the scripts, download the dataset from the below link and *place it in the ```data/``` folder***:   
https://www.kaggle.com/moooozzz/uk-general-elections-2019-twitter-replies/download/d9605jnsmJzxiElRfmA2%2Fversions%2FwQuM603sN8oCEFqejtwX%2Ffiles%2Ftweets_json.json?datasetVersionNumber=1

2. ```data/final_data``` : Scrapped Tweets  
This folder contains tweet data in csv files collected by scraping historical tweets that were discussing the UK election 
or Brexit during that period with GetOldTweets3 python package. In addition to the scrapped tweets, the accountâ€™s information 
such as number of friend count, follower count are also collected using Twitter API with Tweepy. 

3. ```data/trainset.csv```: Train set for training xgboost model for social bots detection    
This labled data is created by us bying merging several open source datasets from 
https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/bot-repository/datasets.html .
  
4. ```data/label.csv``` :   
Label data derived from the social bots detection part. Used in network Analysis, Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis.  
  
5. ```data/mp_party.csv``` :   
This dataset contains twitter account information of candidates for different British Parties manually labeled by us.
  
6. ```data/UK_Poll.xlsx``` :   
This data contains public poll results in a daily basis used in Sentiment Analysis.  

7. ```data/edge.csv``` and ```data/node.csv``` :  
Network dataset created from Network analysis part (```data/node.csv``` is created via the visualization tool - Gephi).
  
  
### Code

1. ```GetOldTweets.py``` :  
Python script for scraping data  

2. ```SocialBotsDetection.ipynb``` :  
Social bots detection script including feature engineering, modeling and predicting labels  

3. ```NetworkAnalysis.ipynb``` :  
Data preprocessing script for Network analysis (Algorithms and visualization part are via Gephi and not included in the code)  

4. ```TopicModeling.ipynb``` :  
Topic modeling script including text preprocessing, EDA, modeling and visualization  

5. ```SentimentAnalysis.ipynb``` :  
Sentiment analysis script including text preprocessing, modeling and visualization
